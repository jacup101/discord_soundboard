# Discord Soundboard
A Discord bot that acts as a soundboard for your server :)
**Note: This bot is very much work in progress, please excuse poor code habits as I clean it up :)**

# Features:
- Bot will join and play designated sound based on emote, including default and server emotes
- Bot reacts to both the use of emote in chat, as well as reactions
- Implementation of a queue system to queue up sounds (although, depending on the sounds, this might not be recommended ðŸ˜…)
- Bot either joins voice channel of user who called it, or joins voice channel with most members if user is not in VC

# WIP
- Music Bot: Create a local library of music and play using discord slash commands

# To be implemented
- Bot currently can only read one emote from a message, can make it read all now that the queue is in place
- Clean up code ðŸ˜…
